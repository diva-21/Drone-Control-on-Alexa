Command and Control movements of a drone using Alexa: Sometimes using a ground control station (GCS) to command and control a drone is tedious. Also, if the drone goes beyond visible line of sight it is even worse. So, an Alexa skill can be developed to voice command the drone to take off, turn right, turn left, return to launch (RTL) and etc.
